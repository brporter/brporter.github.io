# Newspapers

I grew up in a house without Internet, because the internet didn't really exist in a way that normal people could use it or even knew of it. We had newspapers. Every morning, the newspaper was delivered to our house, and would find its way to the family dinner table. We had a very small house, so the dinner table in the kitchen (there was no dining room) was the place of congregation.

I learned things about the newspaper. That the news was fact, objective fact, and not opinion. That biases happened in news, but journalistic ethic systems as a whole would ultimately shake loose the cranks and opportunists from the ranks of ethical journalists and run them out of town. This fact made it important to know from where your news was coming. Reliable news sources were known, trustworthy, and not niche outfits that had not existed long.

I also learned that opinion in a reliable news source would always be clearly labeled as such. In fact, they even had a special section for it, called "Editorials". I learned that the ads you saw in the paper were specifically and explicitly sold by folks isolated from the newsroom - the journalists had no knowledge or say, and did not in fact care, what ads were sold in the paper. A special person called an "ombudsman", independently appointed from the publisher, worked to ensure that these independence divisions remained so.

In the information age of my childhood, a wild theory or vacuous opinion would never be amplified and shared, never exist far outside the voice box of the person espousing it, because newspapers - reliable, ethical news sources - would never amplify the nonsense, the vitriol, the clearly biased claptrap.

This was because information was *expensive*. To spread something far and wide, you needed a printer, and paper, and ink, and a distribution system, and someone to subscribe to you, and even then you were limited in reach to your local community. Did you want your editorial to be published nationally, or even internationally? Good luck.

I collect old phones. Ancient, analog, pulse-driven devices that cannot work on modern VoIP phone systems. It's a hobby. None of my phones support tone dialing - the funny noises your phones make when you push a button, to signal to the telephone network which button was pushed. They all require a telephone network that supports pulse dialing, an archaic form of telephone signaling. These phones, as a result, cannot work on modern telephone systems.

Except that they can be made to work quite easily. There are a number of outfits online that sell *pulse to tone* converters. Special devices that convert pulse dialing devices to tone dialing devices, that will work on all modern VoIP systems today.
